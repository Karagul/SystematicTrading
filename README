Note that: The parameters used in these strategies are not optimized. Depends on the market condition and different factors arised, some strategies are more effective than the others. 
Hence, more work needs to be done before being able to apply these strategies in practice:
- More optimizations
- More backtestings
- More statistical tests to check the market inefficiencies for different assets
- More theories and implementations on different aspects in trading: new signal genaration, new position sizing, etc.  

Most of the strategies are implemented in MQL4 so that I can directly use them in Metatrader for optimization and backtesting. Moreover, I can switch to live trading after thorough analysis. 

Every folder includes the necessary code to run the strategy or the statistical test. Note that: To run a strategy in MetaTrader4, the strategy script should be saved in the "Experts" folder and the indicator script should be saved in the "Indicators" folder.

Every strategy script usually starts with a trading strategy description such as entry rules, exit rules, stop loss and take profit criteria and position sizing.
